# Waterican

A mod that add watering cans that make crops grow faster.

## Dependencies

This mod can work without any other mods but will have no purpose other than novelty.

The `default` mod is required to have the different Waterican types, and the `bucket` mod is needed to be able to craft them.

It can speed up the growth rate of any `farming`-registered plant, or any other mod that use a compatible scheme (that is, `<modname>:seed_<plantname>` + `seed` group for seeds and `<modname>:<plantname>_<growthstage>` + `plant` group for different plant growth stages).

## Crafting

If both `default` and `bucket` are available, Watericans can be crafted like this:

```
U = Water bucket
O = Crafting material

    O
O U O
  O  
```

Crafting materials includes wood, cobblestone, bronze, steel, gold, mese (crystals) and diamond.

The bucket is **not** consumed, only the water it contains is.

## Uses
